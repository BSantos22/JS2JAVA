**SUMMARY: This project generates Java code from a subset of JavaScript. 
	The input is the AST of the JavaScript code and the output is Java. 
	The Javascript code consists of one or more functions and global variables. 
	The framework uses an input JSON file describing the types of the variables used in the input Javascript code. 
	For variables without a type definition, the framework performs type inference.
 	Besides the code generated the framework outputs the type considered for each variable in the Javascript code.
 
**EXECUTE: After compiling the source code, in an IDE for example, run JS2Java.java and follow the instructions given by the interface
 
**DEALING WITH SYNTACTIC ERRORS: (Describe how the syntactic error recovery of your tool does work. Does it exit after the first error?)
 
**SEMANTIC ANALYSIS: (Refer the possible semantic rules implemented by your tool.)
 
**INTERMEDIATE REPRESENTATIONS (IRs): (for example, when applicable, briefly describe the HLIR (high-level IR) and the LLIR (low-level IR) used, 
	if your tool includes an LLIR with structure different from the HLIR)
 
**CODE GENERATION: (when applicable, describe how the code generation of your tool works and identify the possible problems your tool has regarding code generation.)
 
**OVERVIEW: (refer the approach used in your tool, the main algorithms, the third-party tools and/or packages, etc.)
 
**TESTSUITE AND TEST INFRASTRUCTURE: (Describe the content of your testsuite regarding the number of examples, the approach to automate the test, etc.)
 
**TASK DISTRIBUTION: (Identify the set of tasks done by each member of the project.)
 
**PROS: (Identify the most positive aspects of your tool)
 
**CONS: (Identify the most negative aspects of your tool)
